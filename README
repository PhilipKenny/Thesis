# SIPHT
So this code began as a modification of the OpenCV2.3.1 implementation of SIFT.
Originally all modified methods were collected in the 'pk' namespace to prevent
naming collisions with the OpenCV methods and classes. Eventually the growing
code led to a lot of separate classes for different methods. Those classes tend 
to be self containing of all the methods they need and obviously don't suffer 
from naming collisions. The result is that most methods have their own methods
but also use functions from namespace pk. So if you can't find the code you're 
looking for, look in the pk.hpp header file.

Other than that, most methods were implemented in their own class and have a 
main function for testing them. This can be seen in the *Test.cpp files. Also
the makefile has an exhausive list of all the possible binaries but without any
explanation.

The Comparator class and the compare.cpp are the main files used to produce the 
results for my thesis. They incorporate the testing methodology. There are also
some miscellaneous python scripts and things floating around. I have left them 
in the repo, just in case.
